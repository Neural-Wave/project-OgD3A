# Bosh Project - Team og D3A

## Overview
A manufacturing plant experiences a sudden decline in product quality, resulting in increased scrap rates. Factory workers request an analysis to identify the root causes of this change. Two datasets are provided: one containing measurements of 2500 parts taken before the quality decline, and another taken after the decline.

## Objectives
- A methodology to determine a graph containing the causal
relationships between the physical quantities measured at the stations
- A way to detect the root causes of the observed change in
Station5_mp_85 and rank them according to their influence
- A visualization of the graph, the detected root causes and their
influence
